## 🌟 Key Features

The "Debugger & Troubleshooter" plugin provides essential, non-disruptive tools for diagnosing and resolving issues on your WordPress site.

* **Troubleshooting Mode (Session-Based):**
    * Activate a unique mode **only visible to your current browser session**.
    * **Simulate Plugin Deactivation:** Selectively "deactivate" plugins. Their assets and code are disabled for you, while the live site remains unchanged for everyone else.
    * **Simulate Theme Switching:** Preview any installed theme safely, while the public-facing site continues to use the active theme.
* **User Role Simulator:** View your site as any other user or role (e.g., Subscriber, Editor) to test permissions and content visibility without knowing their password. Includes a safe "Exit" button in the Admin Bar.
* **Live Debugging:**
    * Safely enable `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` from the admin dashboard with a single click—no editing `wp-config.php`.
    * Errors are logged to `debug.log` without being displayed on the public site (`WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY` is kept off).
    * View and clear the `debug.log` file directly in the plugin's interface.
* **Comprehensive Site Information:** Get an organized, collapsible overview of your entire WordPress environment:
    * Detailed PHP, Database, and Server information.
    * Full list of all themes and plugins with their status.
    * Important WordPress constants.
    * **Copy to Clipboard:** One-click button to copy all site info for easy sharing with support.
* **Cache Bypassing:** Automatically attempts to bypass caching (by defining `DONOTCACHEPAGE`) when Troubleshooting Mode is active, ensuring your changes are reflected instantly.

## 📖 Usage Guide

Navigate to **Tools > Debugger & Troubleshooter** in your WordPress dashboard to access all features.

### 1. Site Information

This section provides an organized overview of your environment in collapsible cards (closed by default). Click a card title (e.g., PHP Information, Database) to expand the details.

### 2. Troubleshooting Mode

Use this session-based section to safely **Simulate Theme Switching** and **Simulate Plugin Deactivation** without affecting your live website for other visitors.

### 3. User Role Simulator

Click the button to switch your view to that of a different user role (like "Subscriber" or "Editor"). This is perfect for testing content restrictions and permissions. A prominent "Exit Simulation" button will appear in your Admin Bar to safely return to your administrator account.

### 4. Live Debugging

Safely manage WordPress's debugging constants from the UI.

* **Enable Live Debug:** Programmatically enables `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG`, logging errors to `wp-content/debug.log` without displaying them on the site.
* **Debug Log Viewer:** A text area displays the contents of your `debug.log` file, allowing real-time error viewing.
* **Clear Log:** Safely clear the `debug.log` file with a single click.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does Troubleshooting Mode work without affecting my live site?**
A: Troubleshooting Mode uses a browser cookie specific to your session. The plugin uses WordPress filters to redirect core functions (which determine active plugins and themes) to your simulated settings. This process is isolated to your browser.

**Q: Will this work if I have a caching plugin active?**
A: Yes. When Troubleshooting Mode is active, the plugin defines the `DONOTCACHEPAGE` constant, which instructs most caching plugins and hosting environments to bypass the cache for your session.

**Q: How does Live Debugging work without editing `wp-config.php`?**
A: The plugin leverages the `plugins_loaded` hook to define the necessary `WP_DEBUG` constants programmatically very early in the WordPress loading sequence, effectively enabling debug mode for all requests while the feature is turned on.
